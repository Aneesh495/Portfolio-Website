Purpose: I want to create a modern, high-performing, animated personal portfolio website that showcases my resume, projects, experiences, skills, and contact information. It should impress recruiters and hiring managers at top tech companies.


Build a stunning, responsive, animated personal portfolio website using React.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.

🎯 Target Audience: Recruiters at top tech firms, collaborators, peers.

🌐 Overall Design:
- Clean, minimal aesthetic with soft shadows, rounded corners, and modern fonts (Inter or IBM Plex Sans).
- Light/dark mode toggle.
- Smooth animations and transitions with Framer Motion.
- Fully responsive layout.

📌 Pages / Sections:

1. **Home**:
   - Animated hero section: “Hi, I'm Aneesh Krishna 👋”
   - Tagline: “Aspiring Software Engineer | Blockchain Enthusiast | CS @ Purdue”
   - Background animation (e.g., particles or waves)

2. **About**:
   - Short bio with photo
   - Education & extracurriculars (Purdue CS Honors + orgs like Boiler Blockchain)
   - Link to resume download

3. **Projects**:
   - Card-style layout with animation on hover
   - Show key projects: Vibe (Java real-time social app), Freelance DAO (Solidity), etc.

4. **Experience**:
   - Timeline or card format
   - List internships, research positions, and impact (Retail Hedging, The Data Mine, etc.)

5. **Skills**:
   - Tech tag cloud or skill grid
   - Languages, tools, certifications

6. **Games** 🎮:
   - Dedicated section or separate page (`/games`)
   - Title: “Just for Fun — Mini Games I Built”
   - Grid layout with game thumbnails or icons
   - Each game opens in a modal or its own React route
   - Suggested games to build:
     - **Tic Tac Toe** (React state logic)
     - **2048** (Sliding puzzle with animations)
     - **Snake** (Canvas + keyboard controls)
     - **Memory Match Cards** (React hooks & timers)
     - **Minesweeper Lite** (grid logic & recursion)
     - **Rock Paper Scissors** (with animation or AI)
     - **Breakout / Pong** (Canvas physics)
     - Include links to GitHub repo for each game

7. **Contact**:
   - Contact form with name, email, and message (React Hook Form + EmailJS)
   - reCAPTCHA
   - Links: GitHub, LinkedIn, Email

🧰 Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS
- Animations: Framer Motion
- Games: React components and/or HTML Canvas + hooks
- Deployment: GitHub Pages or Vercel
- Optional: EmailJS / Netlify Forms for contact

📦 Extras:
- Navbar with active link highlight
- SEO tags, social previews
- Favicon and custom domain ready
- Easter egg route like `/secret` or `/games/puzzle`
- Easily expandable to add more games or projects in the future

Make the code modular and scalable — all game components should be in a `/games` folder and dynamically rendered from a list. Use lazy loading for better performance.
